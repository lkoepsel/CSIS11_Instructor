# Week 7 - Refining the Editing Process

## Instructions

1. **Copy and paste both this README and the *code* folder into week_7 in your *CSIS11_Student/assembly* folder.**
2. Follow the assignment by writing code or pasting images from the simulator into your *README* file.
3. If the assignment asks for a program file, place the file in the *code* folder with the assigned name

## Refining both your editing skills and your knowledge of LC-3 Assembly code

### Objectives
1. More intensive coding to refine your editing process
2. Using branches to add decision-making abilities
3. Using Traps for I/O in ASCII characters

### Assignments
Use *trap_branch.asm* for all of the assignments below. In some of the assignments, you will need to modify code and take a screen shot. In others, you will be simply adding code. 

1. Change the beginning headers to be text you want for your *Simple Math Calculator (SMC)* and take a screenshot showing the new text.

2. Determine the decimal number (0-9), from the ASCII input and store each digit in a memory location. Document the code.

3. Output the four digits in a row, so that it is easy to view and think of them as a 4 digit decimal number. The first digit needs to be the leftmost digit and the last digit would be the rightmost digit, just as you would right them. Show a screenshot of the input and the output of the numbers.

4. Combine the numbers into a four digit number, with the rightmost digit being a 10^0 digit, second digit from the right, 10^1 etc. Store this new decimal number in a memory location. Document the code.

Once you have finished all four assignments, be sure to commit and sync your commits to your Github account.
